# Starfield Economy Research Notes

## General Observations
- The economy in Starfield is static with prices fixed across all regions.
- Items have set values that do not reflect real-world pricing or rarity.

## Price Fluctuations
- Prices do not fluctuate with supply and demand.

## Resource Availability
- Resources vary by planet but lack logical regional differences.
- Some planets have a mix of resources that do not align with their environment.

## NPC Trade Behaviors
- NPCs have static inventories with no dynamic changes based on player actions or market conditions.
- Merchant categories are not diversified enough, leading to unrealistic trading behaviors.

## Regional Differences
- There are no significant regional economic differences observed.
- Enemy factions have different equipment, but this does not affect the economy.

## Potential Improvements
- Introduce dynamic pricing based on supply and demand.
- Implement regional variations in resource availability and pricing.
- Enhance NPC trade behaviors to be more realistic.
- Add a skill tree for economic perks to influence trading.

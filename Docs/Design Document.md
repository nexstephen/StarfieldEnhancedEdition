# Starfield Enhanced Edition Design Document v0.0.4

## Introduction
Starfield Enhanced Edition is a comprehensive mod aimed at creating a completely realistic economic overhaul for Starfield. This mod will modify various game mechanics to achieve a dynamic and immersive economic system.

## Goals
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Implement a system where prices fluctuate based on supply and demand.
- **Regional Economies:** Create distinct economic regions with unique pricing and availability.
- **Advanced NPC Behaviors:** Develop merchant AI that adjusts prices based on economic conditions.
- **Faction Dynamics:** Introduce economic interactions between different factions.
- **Environmental and Seasonal Effects:** Include weather and seasonal changes that impact the economy.
- **Crafting and Production Systems:** Expand crafting mechanics to reflect realistic economic principles.

## Features

### Dynamic Pricing
- **Description:** Implement a system where prices fluctuate based on supply and demand.
- **Functionality:** 
  - Prices increase when demand is high and supply is low.
  - Prices decrease when demand is low and supply is high.
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - Use Papyrus scripts to track the supply and demand of items.
  - Update item prices periodically based on current supply and demand levels.
- **Example:**
  - If a player buys a large quantity of health potions from a merchant, the price of health potions will increase until supply is replenished.

### Regional Economies
- **Description:** Create distinct economic regions with unique pricing and availability.
- **Functionality:**
  - Different regions have different base prices for items.
  - Availability of certain items varies by region.
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - Define economic regions in the game.
  - Assign base prices and item availability to each region.
  - Use Papyrus scripts to adjust prices and availability based on the region.
- **Example:**
  - Weapons are cheaper in a region with a strong military presence and more expensive in a remote area.

### Advanced NPC Behaviors
- **Description:** Develop merchant AI that adjusts prices based on economic conditions.
- **Functionality:**
  - Merchants adjust their prices based on local supply and demand.
  - Merchants may offer discounts or price hikes based on player reputation and negotiation skills.
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - Use Papyrus scripts to monitor economic conditions and adjust merchant prices accordingly.
  - Implement AI behaviors that consider player reputation and skills when setting prices.
- **Example:**
  - A merchant in a wealthy area may charge higher prices, while a merchant in a poor area may offer discounts to attract customers.

### Faction Dynamics
- **Description:** Introduce economic interactions between different factions.
- **Functionality:**
  - Different factions have their own economic systems and interact with each other.
  - Faction reputation affects trade agreements and economic policies.
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - Define economic behaviors for each faction.
  - Use Papyrus scripts to handle interactions and trade agreements between factions.
- **Example:**
  - A faction that controls a rich resource area may have more economic power and influence trade routes.

### Environmental and Seasonal Effects
- **Description:** Include weather and seasonal changes that impact the economy.
- **Functionality:**
  - Weather and seasons affect resource availability and prices.
  - Events like droughts or floods can impact the economy.
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - Use Papyrus scripts to track weather and seasonal changes.
  - Adjust resource availability and prices based on environmental conditions.
- **Example:**
  - During winter, food prices may rise due to reduced agricultural output.

### Crafting and Production Systems
- **Description:** Expand crafting mechanics to reflect realistic economic principles.
- **Functionality:**
  - Crafting recipes require realistic amounts of resources.
  - Production systems reflect real-world supply and demand.
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - Revise crafting recipes to be more realistic.
  - Use Papyrus scripts to manage production systems and resource allocation.
- **Example:**
  - Crafting a sword requires a realistic amount of metal and labor.

## Flowcharts and Diagrams

### Flowchart for Dynamic Pricing
- Create a flowchart that outlines the logic for updating item prices based on supply and demand.
- Include steps for tracking supply and demand, calculating new prices, and updating the game.

### Diagram for Regional Economies
- Create a diagram that shows the different economic regions and their base prices and item availability.
- Include connections between regions to show trade routes and economic interactions.

### Flowchart for Merchant AI
- Create a flowchart that outlines the logic for merchant AI behaviors.
- Include steps for adjusting prices based on economic conditions and player interactions.

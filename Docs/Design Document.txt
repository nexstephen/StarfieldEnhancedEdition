# Starfield Enhanced Edition Design Document

## Introduction
**Starfield Enhanced Edition** aims to create a comprehensive and realistic economic overhaul for Starfield. This mod will integrate dynamic pricing, regional economies, advanced NPC behaviors, faction dynamics, and environmental effects to provide a richer and more immersive gameplay experience. By introducing these elements, the mod will enhance the economic complexity and realism of the game, making player decisions more impactful and engaging.

## Goals
- **Realistic Economy:** Create a dynamic economic system that reflects real-world supply and demand principles.
- **Immersive Gameplay:** Enhance immersion by integrating advanced NPC behaviors and faction dynamics that react to economic changes.
- **Environmental Impact:** Implement environmental and seasonal effects that influence resource availability and pricing.
- **Crafting and Production:** Develop comprehensive crafting and production systems that contribute to the economy.
- **Player Agency:** Increase player agency by allowing them to influence the economy through their actions and decisions.

## Core Features
### Dynamic Pricing
- Implement a system where prices of goods fluctuate based on supply and demand.
- Allow player actions to influence market prices.

### Regional Economies
- Establish regional variations in pricing and resource availability.
- Develop trade routes that impact the flow of goods between regions.

### Advanced NPC Behaviors
- Enhance NPC AI to react dynamically to economic conditions.
- Implement realistic merchant behaviors, including price adjustments and trading decisions.

### Faction Dynamics
- Develop a system where faction relationships and trade agreements impact the economy.
- Allow player reputation and actions to influence faction dynamics.

### Environmental and Seasonal Effects
- Introduce seasonal changes that affect resource production and availability.
- Implement weather-related events that impact the economy (e.g., droughts, floods).

### Crafting and Production Systems
- Expand the crafting system with more recipes and complex requirements.
- Integrate production units (e.g., factories, workshops) that convert raw materials into finished goods.

## High-Level Mechanics
- **Interaction of Systems:** The dynamic pricing, regional economies, and advanced NPC behaviors will interact to create a complex and realistic economic system. For example, a drought in one region might increase the price of food, affecting trade routes and NPC behaviors.
- **Player Influence:** Players can influence the economy by trading, crafting, and engaging in faction activities. Their actions will have tangible impacts on prices, resource availability, and faction dynamics.
- **Environmental Integration:** Seasonal and environmental effects will add variability and challenge, requiring players to adapt their strategies to changing conditions.

## Initial Concepts
- **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm that adjusts prices based on supply and demand metrics.
- **Regional Economy Map:** Create a map outlining different regions, their resources, and trade routes.
- **NPC AI Flowchart:** Design a flowchart to illustrate how NPCs will make economic decisions based on the player's actions and environmental conditions.
- **Faction Dynamics Model:** Draft a model showing how faction relationships and trade agreements will influence the economy.
